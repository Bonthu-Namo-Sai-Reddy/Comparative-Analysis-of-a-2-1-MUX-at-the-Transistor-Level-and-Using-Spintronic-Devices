# Comparative-Analysis-of-a-4-1-MUX-at-the-Transistor-Level-and-Using-Spintronic-Devices
We are a team of 4 students from K L University Hyderabad working on a project under the courses Integrated System Design Automation and Analog VLSI Design. Our project focuses on drafting a paper titled "Comparative Analysis of a 4:1 MUX at the Transistor Level and Using Spintronic Devices."

The project "Comparative Analysis of a 4:1 MUX at the Transistor Level (90nm) and Using Spintronic Devices" focuses on comparing the performance of a 4:1 multiplexer (MUX) designed with traditional 90nm CMOS transistors and emerging spintronic devices.

Key aspects include analyzing power consumption, speed, and area efficiency of both technologies. While CMOS is optimized for speed, spintronics offers potential advantages in low power and non-volatility. This comparison aims to assess whether spintronics can outperform or complement CMOS for future low-power, high-efficiency digital circuits.

This Project presents a comparative analysis of a 4:1 multiplexer (MUX) implemented at the transistor level using CMOS technology and with emerging spintronic devices. A 4:1 MUX is a fundamental building block in digital systems, and its performance is critical in determining the overall efficiency of such systems. While CMOS technology is widely used due to its maturity and high-speed performance, it faces limitations in power consumption, scalability, and leakage currents as feature sizes continue to shrink. Spintronics, which exploits the spin of electrons for data storage and logic operations, offers a promising alternative with advantages in energy efficiency, non-volatility, and scalability.
The analysis examines key metrics such as power consumption, switching speed, integration density, and scalability. A detailed comparison highlights the strengths and limitations of each technology, with particular focus on the trade-offs between speed and power efficiency. The study also explores the potential of spintronic devices to complement or replace CMOS technology in future low-power, high-density applications.
