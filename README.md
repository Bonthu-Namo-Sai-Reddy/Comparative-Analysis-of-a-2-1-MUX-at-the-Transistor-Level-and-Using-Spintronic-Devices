# Comparative-Analysis-of-a-4-1-MUX-at-the-Transistor-Level-and-Using-Spintronic-Devices
We are a team of 4 students from K L University Hyderabad working on a project under the courses Integrated System Design Automation and Analog VLSI Design. Our project focuses on drafting a paper titled "Comparative Analysis of a 4:1 MUX at the Transistor Level and Using Spintronic Devices."

The project "Comparative Analysis of a 4:1 MUX at the Transistor Level (90nm) and Using Spintronic Devices" focuses on comparing the performance of a 4:1 multiplexer (MUX) designed with traditional 90nm CMOS transistors and emerging spintronic devices.

Key aspects include analyzing power consumption, speed, and area efficiency of both technologies. While CMOS is optimized for speed, spintronics offers potential advantages in low power and non-volatility. This comparison aims to assess whether spintronics can outperform or complement CMOS for future low-power, high-efficiency digital circuits.
